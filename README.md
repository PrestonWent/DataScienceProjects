# DataScienceProjects

Here are some of my projects relating to data analysis or data science. Each project folder 
includes the relevant data, code, and outputs. The environment folder details the environment 
used in analysis, and should allow the user to recreate it.

If you attempt to view a .ipynb file and it refuses to load, copy the url of that file and paste it 
in the search bar [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
